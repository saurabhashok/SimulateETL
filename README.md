Creating a connection to Mysql and extract and transform data and export it to Redshift

# Data Extraction and Transformation Pipeline

This Python project is designed to extract data from a MySQL database, export it to a .dat file, apply data transformations, and load the transformed data into an Amazon Redshift database.

## Getting Started

Before running the code, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Required Python packages installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python pandas psycopg2


   MySQL server up and running with the database you want to extract data from.

Amazon Redshift cluster ready to receive the transformed data.

Configuration
To configure the project, you need to set the following environment variables:

MYSQL_HOST: Hostname or IP address of the MySQL server.
MYSQL_USER: MySQL username.
MYSQL_PASSWORD: MySQL password.
MYSQL_DB: Name of the MySQL database.
REDSHIFT_HOST: Hostname or endpoint of your Amazon Redshift cluster.
REDSHIFT_PORT: Port number for the Redshift database.
REDSHIFT_DB: Name of the Redshift database.
REDSHIFT_USER: Redshift username.
REDSHIFT_PASSWORD: Redshift password.

Running the Code
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Configure the environment variables as described in the "Configuration" section.
Run the data extraction and transformation script:
python extract_transform_load.py
This script will perform the following steps:

Extract data from the MySQL database.
Export the data to a .dat file.
Apply necessary data transformations (modify strings, etc.).
Load the transformed data into the Redshift database.
Check the Redshift database to ensure the data has been successfully loaded.

Notes
Make sure to handle sensitive information like passwords and access keys securely.
